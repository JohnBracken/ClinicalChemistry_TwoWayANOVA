The following SAS code evaluates data taken from healthdata.gov.  
The data was taken from the clinical chemistry database of the 
website.  The data show the effects of acetominophen on albumin 
levels in the F344/N strain of rats, from a preclinical study.
Rats were grouped into 3 different dosage levels (150, 1500 and
2000 mg/kg) of acetominophen and also time spent in the study
(6, 24 and 48 hours).  Therefore, since there were two factor 
variables, dosage and time in study, a two-way ANOVA analysis
was done, with albumin level (units g/dL) as the dependent variable.
A tukey post hoc comparison was done to compare pairs of factor variables.
The results showed that there were differences in albumin levels with dosage,
which were significant between the 150 mg/kg and either of the two high dosage
levels.  There didn't seem to be much difference in results between the 1500 and
2000 mg/kg dosage levels.  Mean albumin also went down with more time in the study.
In particular, mean albumin went down significantly between 6 and 24 hrs time in 
the study, but the drop was not significant between 24 and 48 hrs.
